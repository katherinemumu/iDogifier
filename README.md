# iDogifier

This project will take in a picture of a dog, and return which breed it closely matches: Pomeranian, Husky or Pug.

Download the required packages in `requirements.txt`. 

Run the script iDogifier.py in python IDLE to open up a GUI. (doesn't work so well in the command line)

Enter the name of an image of a dog into the input box, and the percent similarity for the matching dog breed will be presented.
